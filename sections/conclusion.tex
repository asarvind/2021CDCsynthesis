Sampled data systems are prone to information loss that can affect stability.  So, we can expect to more robustly stabilize the system by applying feedback based on the previous sample when current sample information is unavailable.  However, finding an appropriate feedback based on previous sample is challenging because of uncertainty in the sampling time.  A simple solution like mapping the expected feedback to be acting on current sample to the feedback acting on previous sample does not effectively stabilize the system.  We explained this in the paper by an example.  Therefore, to synthesize an effective feedback based on previous sample which can result in large increment in the stabilizing sampling time interval, we developed a novel algorithm based on complex zonotopes which use eigenstructure of the dynamics.  Our evaluation on benchmark examples demonstrates that the algorithm can stabilize the system for much larger values of uncertainty in sampling time than the values for which it was originally stable.
