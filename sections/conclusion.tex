Since sampled data systems are prone to information loss that can affect stability, we can expect to more robustly stabilize the system by applying feedback based on the previous sample.  However, finding an appropriate feedback based on previous sample and the time at which to apply such feedback is challenging because of uncertainty in the time at which the future state information becomes available.  We explained this in the paper by an example.  To synthesize effective feedback based on previous sample, we developed a novel algorithm based on complex zonotopes which use eigenstructure of the dynamics.  Our evaluation on benchmark examples demonstrates that the algorithm can stabilize the system for much larger values of uncertainty in sampling time than the values for which it was originally stable.
