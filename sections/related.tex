Before continuing we briefly discuss related work. The uncertainty induced  communication networks and protocols in NCS, such as  variable sampling period, variable communication delays, and packet loss, has been intensively considered in the literature which has become very vast. We therefore refer the reader to a thorough survey~\cite{Heemels2010}. Concerning continuous-time models as used in our work, delay-differential equations (DDEs) have been used to model variable sampling intervals and their stability is studied using Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional method and linear matrix inequality-based techniques. Additionally Impulsive DDEs are also used to capture better the update nature of control laws.  When not all the data is used, the uncertain delays can be captured in one delay variable that determines the most recent available control input. Then, constructing polytopic embeddings of the uncertain system are proposed using interval matrices, the real Jordan form, the Taylor series. Concerning stabilizing feedback controller design, our approach is similar to the one using dynamical control law with a lifted state variable. However, instead of using LMI techniques we used set-based stability conditions and complex zonotopes to find stabilizing feedback controllers. Since complex zonotopes allow capturing eigenstructure of the dynamics, stability conditions can be checked accurately, leading to larger solution sets.
