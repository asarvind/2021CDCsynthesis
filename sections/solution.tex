%\subsection{Relation between invariant set and stability}
The stability of the system can be established by the existence of a contractive set around origin containing the ball of unit radius, as described in the following lemma.
%
\begin{lemma}~\label{lem:invstability}
The system is $\lambda$-exponentially stable if there exists a set $\Psi\subseteq\reals$ such that $\max_{z\in\Psi}\norm{z}<\infty$, $\ball{0}{1}\subseteq \Psi$ and $\forall \tau\in\sqb{\lb,\ub}$ $\R{\tau}\Psi\subseteq \lambda\Psi$.
\end{lemma}
%
\begin{proof}
Let us denote $r = \max_{z\in\Psi}\norm{z}$ which is finite as considered in the above lemma.  We have $\cs{0}\subseteq \norm{\cs{0}}\ball{0}{1}\subseteq\norm{\cs{0}}\Psi$.  Then we derive the following.
%
\begin{align*}
    & \cs{k} = \prod_{i=1}^k\R{\rb{t_k-t_{k-1}}}\cs{i} \subseteq \prod_{i=1}^k\R{\rb{t_k-t_{k-1}}}\norm{\cs{0}}\Psi\\
    & = \norm{\cs{0}}\prod_{i=1}^k\R{\rb{t_k-t_{k-1}}}\Psi \subseteq \norm{\cs{0}}\lambda^k\Psi
\end{align*}
%
Then we get $\norm{\cs{k}}\leq \norm{\cs{0}}\lambda^k\max_{z\in\Psi}\norm{z} = r\norm{\cs{0}}\lambda^k$.  As this $r$ is constant for all initial states $\cs{0}$, we get that the system is $\lambda$-exponentially stable.
\end{proof}
%
Therefore, to stabilize the system, we can find an $F_p$, $\theta$ and a set $\Psi$ satisfying the conditions of Lemma~\ref{lem:invstability}.  The choice of the set $\Psi$ affects the robustness of our solution, i.e., the $\ub$ for which stabilization can be achieved.  It has been previously shown that using the eigenstructure of the system dynamics inside a set representation called complex zonotope~\cite{adimoolam2016using}, stability can be verified for larger ranges of $\ub$ on benchmark examples than other set methods.  So, in this paper, our choice for the $\Psi$ is a complex zonotope and we extend its application to stabilize the system, i.e. find $F_p$ and $\theta$.  Firstly, we discuss necessary operations on a complex zonotope in the following section.
