\begin{abstract}
We consider the problem of stabilizing a linear sampled data control
system under uncertain sampling periods for the system state.  The
control structure can account for distributed components, and in
particular we focus on synthesizing feedback based on a previous
sample when the current sample is not available, which allows
achieving more robust controllers.  However, stabilization may not be
achieved for large enough uncertainty in sampling period, if we use
time evolution to map the feedback based on current sample to the
feedback based on previous sample.  Alternatively, we propose a
stabilization technique that employs complex zonotopes generated by
eigenvectors of the dynamics to represent invariant sets, from which
the feedback matrix acting on the previous state sample is derived.
Complex zonotopes are an extension of real-valued zonotopes to the
complex number domain, which has been previously used to effectively verify
stability of sampled data control systems.  In this paper, we extend
the application of complex zonotopes to control synthesis.  We
evaluate our approach on benchmark examples and demonstrate
stabilization on larger ranges of uncertainty on sampling time periods
than the uncertainty ranges proposed in the benchmarks.
